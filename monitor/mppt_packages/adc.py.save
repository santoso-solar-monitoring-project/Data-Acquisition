    The ADC Reader class allows for the user to easily set up a connection to
    the ADS1015

    The default address for the ADS1015 is 0x48, but you can change which ADS
    you are connected to by specifying address in __init__

    Example: adc = ADC_Reader(address=0x49)
         voltage = adc.read_voltage()

    read_voltage returns the voltage formatted as a floating integer
    read_raw returns the raw data value the ADS reads

    sample assumes you have the positive side of the shunt resistor plugged into
    A0 and the negative side in A1, and the open circuit voltage plugged into
    A2
    It will return the voltage from the open circuit and the current going over
    the shunt resistor, as well as the average voltage and current specified
    from the number of samples
